## Practice Set: Building a Simple Image Gallery with Tailwind CSS 

### Learning Goals 

- Structure a webpage using HTML 

- Style layouts using Tailwind CSS 

- Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM 

- Understanding how JavaScript interacts with existing DOM elements 

### Overview 

- This practice set introduces students to building a clean, responsive image gallery using HTML and Tailwind CSS within an Astro project. The gallery displays a set of static image cards arranged in a responsive grid. Each image links to a full-size version that opens in a new browser tab when clicked. 

- The goal of this practice set is to reinforce foundational concepts of HTML structure, utility-based styling, and responsive layout, while demonstrating how simple interactivity can be achieved using standard HTML behavior. 

### Learning Objectives 

By completing this practice set, students will be able to: 

- Structure a webpage using HTML elements 

- Create a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS 

- Use anchor (<a>) elements to link images to full-size versions 

- Apply Tailwind utility classes for spacing, typography, and layout 

### Starter Code 

Students are given a partially completed image gallery containing three image cards, each including: 

- A thumbnail image 

- A caption describing the image 

- A link that opens the full-size image in a new browser tab 

The images are sourced from Picsum Photos but students are welcome to pull from other sources (avoiding copyright). 

An example of the starter code can be found at the bottom of this document. The repository can be accessed here: https://github.com/melanie2mason-prog/Practice-Set.git 

### Tasks 

#### Add images 

- Add six additional image cards to the gallery 

- Each image must include a thumbnail image, a full-size link that opens in a new tab, and a simple caption 

#### Responsiveness 

- The gallery should display one column on small screen, two on medium screens, and three on large screens 

- Images should scale appropriately on different screen sizes 

#### Style the Gallery 

- Use Tailwind utility classes to incorporate unique styling and displays 

- There should be consistent spacing between image cards 

- Transition effects should be included 

- Students are encouraged to experiment with colors, spacing, and layout to create a unique design 

### Key Concepts 

- HTML: Use of header, section, footer, and structured div elements to organize content 

- Responsive design: Tailwind’s grid utilities enable layouts that adapt across different screens 

- Opening images in a new tab is accomplished using standard HTML links
